The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the leadership of the 
pq-code-package project. It's role is to:

- Set the overall strategy of the project ie across all our algorithm 
implementations & supporting subprojects
- Liase with the PQCA TAC providing feedback and raising issues and concerns
- resolve any issues within the project community

## Members

The initial TSC was created based on the intial contributors during the project inception. 

Subsequent members may be voted onto the TSC, the process for doing so will be clarified at a later stage.

## Meetings

Meetings are open to everyone, but only TSC members may vote. 

Minutes and recordings will generally be made available. If you are concerned about recording or minutes this may be noted, and recording/minuting then suspended for the appropriate discussion.
