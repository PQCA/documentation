The PQ Code Package project is a new open source project that aims to build high-assurance software implementations of standards-track post-quantum cryptography algorithms. The PQCP is a project within the Linux Foundation as part of the Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance.

Our initial focus in the first phase of the project will be on the Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) algorithm. As the project grows, we intend to also produce implementations for ML-DSA and SLH-DSA, as well as other standards-track post-quantum algorithms.

We aim for implementations produced by the project to have assurances given either as a result of external audits or as a result of formal verification methods (or both).
