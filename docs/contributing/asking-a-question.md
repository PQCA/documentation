## Chat
[PQCA's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/xyVnwzfg5R) is the place to go for real-time chat about everything from quick help to involved discussions.

For general pq-code-package discussions, join the Discord server and visit the channels in the **PQ Code Package** section, for example:

- pqcp-general : general discussions
- pqcp-tsc : Technical steering committee

Other channels will be added as individual projects opt to use discord to continue async discussions.

## Github discussions
